# Fitness-Planner: Welcome to my First Full Web App Ever!

## Usage
- People can enter the physical activity that they have already completed. They can also add plans for future activity. The app prevents people from entering planned dates in the past, or finished activity into the future. The user can also see progress bars that include their finished activities over time.  Last, a reminder box pops up when the app is entered, asking the user if they finished their most recently planned item.

## Skills Developed
- Teamwork: Built this program in a team of two, which required communication. Additionally, it helped us both discover who was better at what, allowing us to hone our skills more.
- CSS, HTML: This was my first foray into HTML and CSS, at all.
- Code Separation into files: The files are organized according to CSS, HTML, JS.

## Issues
- The Google Sign in Button had to be removed for now. The Google Auth updated to 2.0, and I do not currently have the time (Oct 8, 2021). This is old code, so it may not be worth updating, anyway.
- Since the Google Sign was removed, everyone gets everyone's newly entered data.  
- The Timezones are wonky, so there is a brief period of time where the items do not work.

## Lessons Learned
  - Absolutely 100% pre-plan the classes for CSS. It makes everything easier.
  - Divide up work beforehand, so two people don't both accidentally write the SQL functions.
  - Timezones are hard. It's much easier when you realize everything ahead of time, and decide exactly where you will plan the transition from Standard to Local time.
